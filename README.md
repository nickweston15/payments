WHAT I BUILT
- Payments checkout out that simulates a checkout flow with multi-currency support
- Mimics a merchant dashboard view
- React frontend and Node.js/Express backend

- This app showcases fluency in Stripeâ€™s core API and the payment concepts that matter to merchants:
  - Conversion optimization (not yet)
  - Fee transparency (not yet)
  - Local payment method strategy
